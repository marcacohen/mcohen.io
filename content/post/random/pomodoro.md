You know that feeling when you have something important to do and you just can't seem to get off the starting block? It's not necessarily an unpleasant task, and once you get working on it, it'll be fine. It's just that the energy required to make the transition from idle to active can feel overwhelming at times. In this article I'm sharing the best solution I've found to this problem.

It's called the *Pomodoro Method* and it's so deceptively simple that, until you try it, it seems like a gimmick.

Here's how it works:
- Define your task list for the day, in priority order.
- Disable notifications, minimize (or better yet, close) all your open browser tabs, move your phone into a different room if you have to.
- Start a timer for 25 minutes.
- Work continuously until the timer goes off.
- Once the timer fires, set yourself a break timer. Most people seem to use 5 minutes for the break but I like 10.
- Repeat the above sequence, until it's time for a longer break.

Pomodoro is Italian for Tomato. You can actually get a physical timer that look like a tomato, but I like using an app. The app I use is called <a target="_blank" href="https://tomighty.org/">Tomighty</a>. It's free, open source, and works on Mac, Windows, and the Web. I love how the Mac version embeds itself into my laptop's task bar, so it's always there, ready for me to use:

Next, I was going to give you some tips and techniques for getting the most out of this method but someone has already done that for me, so <a target="_blank" href="https://calmcode.io/course/pomodoro/introduction">here's a link</a> to Vincent Warmerdam's excellent short video series on getting the most out of the Pomodoro method, which I highly recommend.

In addition to the basic mechanics of use, Vincent also shares a bunch of meta-techniques and suggestions to make your focus sessions...more focussed. By the way, if you like these videos, check out the rest of the content on <a target="_blank" href="https://calmcode.io">calmcode.io</a>. It's an incredible trove of first rate instructional content on Python Programing, Data Science, and other cool topics, all presented in Vincent's inimitable calm and lucid style.

Give the Pomodoro method a try - it's been a game changer for me.
