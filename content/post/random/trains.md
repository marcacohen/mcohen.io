I didn’t know this was even possible but apparently you can travel across the entire United States by train.

Article: <a target="_blank" href="https://wapo.st/3MLtNKx">Seeing America by Train</a>

I enjoyed this piece in two different ways:

- It tells a compelling story about one person’s experience traveling over 80 hours, 12 states, and 3,397 miles.

- It’s beautifully illustrated and a nice example of visual storytelling via the web.

I’ve always been disappointed that rail travel is not more ubiquitous in the US (see <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car">Who Killed the Electric Car</a> for an interesting take on why that is). Thankfully, I’ve been able to enjoy traveling by train more often since moving to the UK.
