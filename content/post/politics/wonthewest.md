Today's one great thing is required viewing if you really want to understand what's going on today in the Middle East.

It's the history of the false narrative Israel built in order to justify stealing land, ethnic cleansing the indigenous population, maintaining its well documented apartheid regime, and the genocide we've all been witnessing live from Gaza.

I especially urge fellow Jewish people to watch this video, to better understand the other side of a story you may have been taught from early childhood, as was I. It will give you a better sense of where this narrative comes from, and how it's been used as a weapon to oppress millions of Palestinians.
